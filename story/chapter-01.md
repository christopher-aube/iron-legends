# Chapter 1 - So it Begins

## Prelude to War

The peace forged in autumn between the great city states of Kathis and Falamon began to thaw during the long winter nights. The two great powers only managed to inflame one another as each sought to bring the other under their rule. With the dawn of spring, the mountain passes along their shared border became clear, giving way to a new season of conflict.

The Kathians aimed to deliver a quick decisive blow by securing their northern border and taking hold of the fertile valleys of Falamon's southern lands. To ensure the success of this new campaign, Kathis called upon their fellow Brennic allies and raised levies from their Edosian colonies.

When the recruiters from the Kathian army came to your home, your master complied with their request and sold you into their service. On the long road to Kathis, you were measured and tested. Showing some fighting promise, you were chosen to serve as a vanguard in the 8th Legion.

After four weeks of training day and night, the drums of war sounded and the 8th Legion marched north.

## Strange Beginnings

Each of the cohorts of the 8th were assigned to secure a specific mountain pass, the Red Dragons were to hold the pass leading into the Aeus Valley. With the omens in your favor, the Red Dragons were able to take the pass and construct a camp without encountering any resistance.

With a foothold established, you and half of the cohort marched north through the heavy forest while keeping close to the westward mountains. After almost three full days of being forced marched at double pace, you stopped at the head of a small river to make camp for the night.

Being a conscript of the lowest rank, provisions awarded to you were extremely light as the heavy infantry and cavalry hoarded supplies. As night fell you and some others took it upon yourselves to forage and hunt for food.

While in the forest, your hunting party found tracks belonging to deer. As the party pushed deeper into the forest the tracks faded into those of wolves. Hungry and low on options, you pushed even further into the woods in an attempt to pick up the trail of deer.

With night firmly set in, the howls began. Not so shortly after, your party was confronted by four wolves. Nearly half of those who set out with you fled back to camp, those that remain steady their weapons. The fight was quick and bloody but you were victorious. Of the four wolves, you killed three. The largest, a grey wolf, managed to escape.

The party was then split again, with half being tasked with taking the body of a fallen conscript back to camp in addition to the corpses of the wolves. You alongside the conscript officer Naal with two others decided to continue your search for the deer.

The trees became so dense that it was impossible for the light of the moon to pierce through. Finding tracks in that kind of darkness just couldn't be done. Of what you could see was strange to you, carvings being etched in trees and stone. The deep you went the prevalent they became.

Being so far into the woods, things became eerily silent and seemed almost devoid of all life. You came upon an owl, perched high, it watched you without stir or stutter. As you walked past this beast, it spoke to you in a language that you did not know.

The carvings you followed lead you to a ruined stone altar surrounded by broken obelisks. As you searched, looking for anything to explain it, Naal would burst into random fits of laughter lasting for just the briefest of moments. Unable to find any sort of explanation, you decided to leave, that is when you noticed it. The carvings and the altar where pointing to the mountain nearby.

You pressed forward towards the mountain and upon reaching its foot, you found an entrance to a cave or possibly an abandoned mine. Off to the side of the entrance laid the body of a male elf dressed in fine purple robes with a dagger shoved in his chest to the hilt.

After some discussion, you and your new friends thought to venture into the mountain in hopes of finding treasure or anything that would lead to a life better than that of a conscript. Naal's fits of laughter completely overtook him, rendering him useless and a liability, so you left him behind.
