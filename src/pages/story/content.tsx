      <h1>Chapter 1 - So it Begins</h1>
<h2>Prelude to War</h2>
<p>The peace forged in autumn between the great city states of Kathis and Falamon began to thaw during the long winter nights. The two great powers only managed to inflame one another as each sought to bring the other under their rule. With the dawn of spring, the mountain passes along their shared border became clear, giving way to a new season of conflict.</p>
<p>The Kathians aimed to deliver a quick decisive blow by securing their northern border and taking hold of the fertile valleys of Falamon's southern lands. To ensure the success of this new campaign, Kathis called upon their fellow Brennic allies and raised levies from their Edosian colonies.</p>
<p>When the Kathian army came to the shores of the Edosian coast looking for recruits, many were sold into service by their masters. Three of these conscripts would soon find themselves forging an unlike bond. Edgar Gooddeal, a half-elf vagabond of questionable origins, Paelias Blir, a cocky half-elf born of misfortune, and William Riddick Thatcher, a proud human with a mysterious past.</p>
<p>On the long road to Kathis, the three were measured and tested. Showing some fighting promise, they were chosen to serve in the 8th Legion vanguard.</p>
<p><img style={style1280}  src=".././assets/symbols/battle-standard-red-dragon-cohort.png" alt="Battle Standard of the Red Dragons" /> Once these raw recruits made it to the great city, they encamped with the rest of the army. Over weeks of training day and night, the conscripts of the 8th Legion were each placed into cohort. Edgar, Paelias, and William were assigned to the Red Dragons, a mixed unit of heavy infantry and light cavalry. As conscripts they would be trained as skirmishers meant to soften and distract the enemy.</p>
<p>Not so shortly after the three were made skirmishers, the drums of war sounded and the 8th Legion marched north to war.</p>
<h2>Strange Beginnings</h2>
<p>Each of the cohorts of the 8th were assigned to secure a specific mountain pass, the Red Dragons were to hold the pass leading into the Aeus Valley. With the omens in their favor, they were able to take the pass and construct a camp on the northern side without encountering any resistance.</p>
<p>With a foothold established, half of the cohort marched north through the heavy forest while keeping close to the westward mountains. After almost three full days of being forced marched at double pace, this detachment stopped at the head of a small river to make camp for the night.</p>
<p>Provisions given to conscripts have always been extremely light in the Kathian army, with most supplies being reserved for heavy infantry or cavalry. Conscripts often take it upon themselves to forage and hunt if they want a decent meal, and this night would be no different. As dusk began Edgar, Paelias, and William joined a hunting party of conscripts lead by the skirmisher officer Naal.</p>
<p>While in the forest, the hunting party found tracks belonging to deer. As they pushed deeper into the forest the tracks faded into those of wolves. Hungry and low on options, they had little choice but to pushed even further into the woods in an attempt to pick up the trail of deer.</p>
<p>With night firmly set in, the howls began and the hunting party became the hunted as they were confronted by wolves. Nearly half of those who set out fled back to camp, those that remain steady their weapons. The fight was quick and bloody and costly for the enemy. Of the four wolves that attacked, three were killed. The largest, a grey wolf, managed to escape.</p>
<p>The party found itself split again, with half being tasked with taking the body of a fallen conscript back to camp in addition to the corpses of the wolves. Edgar, Paelias, William, and Naal set out to pick up the tracks and hunt down the deer.</p>
<p>The trees became so dense that it was impossible for the light of the moon to pierce through the forest canopy. Finding tracks in that kind of darkness just could not be done. Of what the four could see was strange, carvings of something long eroded etched into trees and rock. The deeper they went the more prevalent the carvings became.</p>
<p>Being so far into the woods, things became eerily silent and seemed almost devoid of all life. The group came upon an owl, perched high, it watched Paelias without stir or stutter. As they walked past this beast, it seemed to speak to them in a language that none could understand.</p>
<p>Following the carvings lead the four of them to a ruined stone altar surrounded by broken obelisks. As they searched, looking for anything to explain it, Naal would burst into random fits of laughter lasting for just the briefest of moments. Unable to find any sort of explanation, they decided to head back to camp, but that is when Edgar noticed it. The carvings and the altar where pointing to the mountain nearby.</p>
<p>The group pressed forward towards the mountain and upon reaching its foot, an entrance as found to a cave or possibly an abandoned mine. Off to the side, laid the body of a elf dressed in fine robes with purple cloak and a dagger shoved in his chest to the hilt.</p>
<p>After some discussion, Edgar, Paelias, and William sought to venture into the mountain in hopes of finding treasure or anything that would lead to a life better than that of a conscript. At the point the fits of laughter afflicting Naal completely overtook him, rendering him useless and a liability, he was left behind.</p>
